# Exercici 1 – Classe sense genèrics (Java 21)

## 📄 Description

This exercise introduces the concept of working **without generics** to understand how Java handles fixed-type classes.

You will create a class called **NoGenericMethods** that stores **three values of the same type**. The goal is to compare this non-generic implementation later with a generic version and observe the differences in flexibility and type safety.

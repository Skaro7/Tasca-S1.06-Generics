# Generics – Fundamentals of Generic Programming (Java 21)

## 📄 Description

This task focuses on one of the most powerful and flexible concepts in Java: **Generics**.

Generics allow you to write code that is:

* More **reusable**
* More **type-safe**
* Cleaner and easier to maintain

By using generics, you avoid manual type casting and reduce runtime errors.

In this level, you will work with:

* Generic classes  
* Generic methods  
* Type flexibility with compile-time safety  

The goal is to understand how Java manages **flexible but safe typing** and to compare non-generic and generic approaches.
